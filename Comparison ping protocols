Great idea! Creating a well-structured Confluence page will make your POCs reusable and show clear technical depth. Here’s a suggested structure and content outline you can directly copy and paste, with detailed explanations for each discovery mechanism:

JGroups Discovery Protocols - AWS Fargate & ECS POC Comparison

Overview

This document outlines the evaluation and implementation details of various JGroups discovery protocols used to enable clustering in Infinispan running on AWS ECS with Fargate. The goal was to identify a production-ready, cloud-native approach that ensures high availability and fault tolerance without relying on unsupported multicast in AWS.


---

1. TCP_PING

Purpose: Static list-based unicast discovery.

How to Use:

<TCPPING initial_hosts="10.0.0.1[7800],10.0.0.2[7800]" port_range="5" />
<TCP bind_port="7800" />

Where to Use:

In controlled environments (EC2, static IPs, or minimal auto-scaling).


Restrictions:

Not suitable for auto-scaling (IP changes).

Requires hardcoded or pre-known IPs.


Ranking: Low (too static, poor flexibility for Fargate).



---

2. UDP / MPING (Multicast-based)

Purpose: Dynamic node discovery using multicast.

How to Use:

<UDP ... />
<MPING />

Where to Use:

On-prem or environments with multicast support.


Restrictions:

NOT supported in AWS VPC / Fargate / ECS.

Multicast packets are dropped in AWS networking.


Ranking: Not usable in AWS (ruled out for Fargate).



---

3. S3_PING

Purpose: Store discovery metadata in S3 bucket.

How to Use:

<S3_PING location="my-discovery-bucket" access_key="..." secret_access_key="..." />

Where to Use:

AWS ECS/Fargate if S3 bucket and IAM permissions are well-defined.


Restrictions:

Requires custom build or plugin (not in default JGroups).

Latency is higher than DB/DNS.

Needs IAM roles and S3 lifecycle management.


Ranking: Medium — viable but not preferred due to performance.



---

4. JDBC_PING

Purpose: Uses a shared DB table to record participating nodes.

How to Use:

<JDBC_PING connection_url="jdbc:mysql://mydb:3306/jgroups"
           driver="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
           user_name="user"
           password="pass" />

Where to Use:

Small clusters, environments already using RDS.


Restrictions:

DB becomes a critical dependency.

Slightly slower than DNS.


Ranking: Medium-High — good if DB exists.



---

5. DNS_PING

Purpose: Uses ECS Service Discovery (Route 53) to resolve peer IPs.

How to Use:

Enable Service Discovery when creating ECS service.

JGroups config:

<DNS_PING dns_query="infinispan.my-namespace.local" />
<TCP bind_port="7800" />


Where to Use:

ECS + Fargate with service discovery enabled.


Restrictions:

TTL and DNS caching delay during scale-down.

Requires correct namespace setup.


Ranking: High — Cloud-native and simple setup.



---

6. Custom ECS_PING (Built In-House)

Purpose: Queries ECS API to dynamically fetch running task IPs.

How to Use:

Implemented using AWS SDK in a custom JGroups PING protocol.

Filter tasks by cluster + service name.

Populate peer list dynamically.


Where to Use:

Best for full control, autoscaling, minimal dependencies.


Restrictions:

Requires custom development + maintenance.

Needs task role with ECS ListTasks, DescribeTasks permissions.


Ranking: Top — Best balance of flexibility, control, and cloud-native design.

Final Comparison Table


---

Conclusion & Recommendation

For a cloud-native, production-ready Infinispan cluster on AWS Fargate, the top two contenders are:

DNS_PING for its simplicity and native ECS support.

ECS_PING for advanced use cases needing real-time discovery, better control, and seamless scaling.


Between them:

Use DNS_PING if you're okay with slight DNS TTL delay.

Use ECS_PING if you want more accurate and real-time node discovery.
